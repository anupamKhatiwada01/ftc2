Specific - Like I said before, “Get fit” won\u0026rsquo;t cut it. Make it more along the lines of “train 3 times a week to lose weight, build muscle, and see my abs”\nM. Measurable - Can you measure it? Ask yourself “Can I see my abs?” No? You still have work to do\nA. Attainable - It has to be something you can actually work towards. Being able to do no handed pushups for example, isn\u0026rsquo;t a thing, so don\u0026rsquo;t even go there.\nR. Realistic - it\u0026rsquo;s no good saying “by tomorrow” because that won\u0026rsquo;t happen. You also can\u0026rsquo;t work towards becoming bulletproof - just keep it real\nT. Time based - give yourself a realistic deadline. Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t quite reach your goal in that time frame, you\u0026rsquo;ll be a lot better than when you started\nPersonally, I work in 90 day sprints, then evaluate the goal\nNow that you know about SMART goals, a good example would be “train 3x a week for the next 90 days so I can see my abs”\nThat\u0026rsquo;s actually doable and will keep you on track\nTip #2 - Create a dedicated space #\rHaving a dedicated space really helps with motovation\nYou have a set area to go to when it\u0026rsquo;s time to train, kind of like going to a gym\nYou have everything you need right there in one place, so there\u0026rsquo;s no time wasting fetching equipment from around the house\nThis makes the perceived effort needed to get a training session in, much lower in your mind\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t need to take up an entire room either\nMy space takes up a doorframe and an exercise mat\nYou could throw in some parralettes and dip bars which could be put to one side when not being used\nWhatever you have though , make sure you have easy access to it from where you train\nTip #3 - Follow a routine #\rIt\u0026rsquo;s far easier to stay consistent when you have a set routine to follow\nTake all the guess work out of it and it becomes a habit a lot easier\nYou know on Monday - you do a b c, Tuesday - X y z, and so on for the whole week\nOnce it becomes a habit, the motivation to train becomes irrelevant\nYou just do it\nTry to stick to working out at the same time of day and treat each session as an important appointment you have with yourself\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t let yourself down this way\nI have a rule I stick to for this:\nNever miss a Monday\nThe rest of the week just falls into place after a Monday session\nTip #4 - Train with friends #\rHaving a training buddy puts pressure on you to show up\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t let your friends down now can you?\nSometimes this can be a challenge when training at home, so joining an online community is a great idea to get around this\nWhen you surround yourself with other people on a similar path, you enjoy talking about progress, programs and seeing what others are doing\nTip #5 - Use Technology #\rApps on your phone make tracking workouts easier\nSome also have communities built in\nThey can have structured programs for you to follow or make tracking your own a piece of low calorie cake\nI use Notion for tracking progress and X for the community side of fitness\nFitness X is full of great people so come and say hello some time\nTip #6 - Mix things up #\rMixing things up is a cheat code for staying motivated\nBoredom provides resistance which leads to quitting\nWe definitely don\u0026rsquo;t want that\nAlthough I recommend sticking to a proven program for building muscle, and burning fat, rest days are a different kettle of fish\nYou could go for a long walk, go swimming, take a hike up a mountain, do some jump rope, or play on the beach with some friends\nKeeping things fun keeps them interesting and enjoyable\nTip #7 - Reward yourself #\rRewarding yourself improves motivation on a psychological level\nWhen you have to go shopping for new clothes because your old ones are too big, it feels great\nA day at the spa for hitting a target is another great reward\nEven a movie night with the family and some popcorn is a great way to reward yourself\nWhen you have something to look forward to on top of your goals, it makes them more enjoyable\nBeing able to tell yourself “I earned this” gives you a great sense of accomplishment\nSet up a reward system for yourself and keep the gains coming\nTip #8 - Stay Positive #\rThis gets easier the more you train\nIn the beginning though, keeping a positive mental attitude will keep you going\nFocus on the benefits you\u0026rsquo;re getting until you feel them kicking in\nThe mental health benefits of this alone make it worth while\nLife happens at times, and a positive outlook will keep you on the rails\nSetbacks don\u0026rsquo;t mean failure\nStaying set back does\nPositivity and focusing on the benefits is the key to keep you on your journey, and reach your goals\nBonus tip - Forget Motivation #\rMotivation just gets you started\nIt could be an event that happens or something somebody says\nThat one event isn\u0026rsquo;t enough to keep you going in the long run\nYou need discipline\nDiscipline is when you do the work, even when you don\u0026rsquo;t feel like it\nYou\u0026rsquo;re never going to think “man, I regret that workout”\nI guarentee you think “man I regret not working out” though\nSometimes it\u0026rsquo;s unavoidable, but if you can do the work, you should do the work, no matter how you feel about it, and you know this\nWe all get days when our minds will tell us not to bother that day, but you must\nEven if you just do one set of pushups, you\u0026rsquo;ll find that once you start, you\u0026rsquo;ll complete your workout for the day\nConclusion #\rSo there\u0026rsquo;s my tips about staying motivated and a bonus that overrides them all\nSet S. M. A. R. T Goals Create a dedicated space Follow a routine Train with friends Use Technology Mix things up Reward Yourself Stay Positive Use Discipline Try to remember: little by little, it becomes a lot\nOne day you\u0026rsquo;ll look back on your progress and think “wow, I did all that” and feel proud of yourself\nI promise\nYou just have to keep pushing forwards\n","date":"14 July

pandemic\nWith people either being more concerned about their health, but unable to visit a gym, they had to turn to the Internet to figure out how to stay fit\nThis post explores how home workouts offer a convenient way to build great strength from the comfort of your own home\nYou see\nEverybody and their nan can do a workout at home\nThere\u0026rsquo;s not a lot of expensive equipment needed, and you don\u0026rsquo;t even have to travel to a gym\nThis makes the cost of doing it accessible to everybody\nThere\u0026rsquo;s zero monthly membership fees and you don\u0026rsquo;t need to buy enough weight plates to sink a battle ship either\nWith home workouts, you are the weight!\nThis also saves you time, which a lot of people use as an excuse not to workout at all!\n“I haven\u0026rsquo;t got time to workout, the gyms too far away”\nDon\u0026rsquo;t be that guy\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to travel anywhere to do them and they can be very short if you\u0026rsquo;re pressed for time\nThink about it…\nHow long does it take you to get off the couch and drop down to the floor to bust out some push ups?\nNow compare that to getting your kit ready, travelling to the gym, doing your workout (hopefully it\u0026rsquo;s quiet so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to wait) and then travel back home again!\nNo ta\nPlus, you get to do it no matter what time of day it is\nIf you prefer really early workouts… No problem\nAnd if you don\u0026rsquo;t have time until after gym hours… You can still get a sweat on at home.\nSo what are the major benefits of this way of training?\nPersonally, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be exercising at all if the gym was my only option\nThe anxiety I would get from the thought of going there stopped me going at all\nThe funny thing is\nNow that I train regularly at home, I could go to the gym because of the confidence I now have\nWorking out improved my mental health incredibly, and it still does\nThe regular exercise improved my ability to focus too\nTheres something about feeling powerful that helps keep you motivated on work\nMaybe it\u0026rsquo;s the testosterone boosting effect of muscle building\nWhatever it is\nWork becomes play, which helps keep you motivated and consistent\nNow I\u0026rsquo;ve heard people say “but you need a gym for progressive overload”\nEeeerrrm… No you don\u0026rsquo;t!\nYou can easily customize your workout plan to increase the difficulty of it\nI\u0026rsquo;m not just talking about doing more reps either\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take push ups for an example\nYou can start them with your hands up high\nThen lower your hands to the floor and use your knees\nThen move on to raising your knees off the floor to make it harder again\nThis is how progressive overload works with home workouts\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t need weights until you\u0026rsquo;re really freaking strong, by which time you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to bust out one armed push ups with ease!\nThis is true with every move you can do to train your entire body\nSpeaking of which…\nFull body workouts are much faster than gym workouts\nSeeing as you train multiple muscles as a group with each movement, there\u0026rsquo;s no need for isolation moves which only work one muscle at a time\nThis makes them grow stronger as a unit, building functional strength\nBasically, you move your body easier this way, even when a heavy load is on you\nAsk my boss\nHe hates how I can lift a 75kg bag of potatoes on top of the fridge like it\u0026rsquo;s nothing\nThe fact is, it\u0026rsquo;s a highly effective way to build overall strength you use every day\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also an effective way to build core strength, as every single movement takes some form of balance to achieve\nYour abs and stabiliser muscles get worked no matter what you\u0026rsquo;re doing, from push ups and pull ups to squats\nThis improves your balance too (pretty handy for a day surfing)\nIf you want to start doing home workouts, here\u0026rsquo;s some practical tips for you to help you get going\nCreate a dedicated space You don\u0026rsquo;t need a large area, but it should be the same area you use every time\nKeep it clutter free and add anything to keep you motivated there\nTry to do it at the same time each week If you can build a habit of working out every morning for example, you\u0026rsquo;ll get further than doing it when you feel like it\nEat carbs before working out A sugary snack like Greek yogurt, berries and honey will give you more energy to burn while you workout\nEating about 30 minutes before starting means that extra energy will be floating around your bloodstream while you train\nTake progress photos Once you notice changes taking place, progress photos can really help keep you motivated\nSometimes the scales don\u0026rsquo;t move very much, even though your body has changed\nMuscle weighs more than fat so progress photos are a better way to track your progress (hence the name)\nSo there you go\nHome workouts are quicker and more convenient than gym workouts and can be done by anyone (ask your nan)\nThey save you money, improve your mental health, and turn you into a machine (not literally though)\nI challenge you to start home workouts and let me know how you get on down below\n","date":"14 July
